    "# Types of Date\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to know what kind of data you are dealing with because techinques mighe have different nuances depending on what kind of data you are handling. There are three specific types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numerical Data\n",
    "* Categorical Data\n",
    "* Ordinal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical Data\n",
    "It represents some quantifiable thing that you can measure, some examples are Heights of People, Page Load Times and so on.\n",
    "There are basically two kinds of Numerical Data\n",
    "* Discrete Data\n",
    "* Continuous Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Data\n",
    "These are numerical values which are Integer Based, For Example how many purchases did a customer make in a year. This can only be integers never a fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Data\n",
    "These are numerical values which have infinite range of possibilities where you can go in fractions. Example - Height of People, there are an infinite number of possibilities when we get to scale of Millimeters. Another example is how much rain fall did we get in a given day, again there are infinite number of precisions there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "To recap, Numerical Data is something you can measure quantitatively with a number, and it can be either DIscrete, where it's Integer Based like a count or Continuous, where you can have infinite range of percision available to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorical Data\n",
    "These are type of data which have no inherent numeric meaning, you cannot compre one category to another directly. Things like Gender, State, Country etc. \n",
    "Example you can say area of Texas is greater than Area of Florida but you cannot say Texas is greater than Florida. But you can assign numerical values like Texas as 1 and FLorida as 3 but there is not relationship between 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordinal Data\n",
    "This is a sort of mixture of Numerical and Categorical Data, Common example is Star Ratings for a Movie, In this case, We have Categorical Data in that could be 1 through 5 Starts, where 1 represents Poor and 5 represent Excellent, But they do not have a mathematical meaning."

    "# Mean, Median and Mode\n",
    "## Mean\n",
    "Mean is also known as Average, To calculate the mean of the data set, we sum up all the values and divide it by number of values the data set has.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sum of Samples / Number of Samples*\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Childern in each house on a Street\n",
    "\n",
    " 0,2,3,2,1,0,0,2,0\n",
    " \n",
    " The Mean is *(0+2+3+2+1+0+0+2+0)/9 = 1.11*\n",
    " \n",
    "## Median\n",
    "The way you calculate median of a data set is by sorting all the values in ascending or descending order and taking the one that ends up in the middle. Using the same data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Childern in each house on a Street  0,2,3,2,1,0,0,2,0\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting the data set in ascending order\n",
    "\n",
    "0,0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we pick the center element of the ordered data which for the above case is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Note - if you have even number of data points, then the median is between the two center data points, in that case we take the average of the two data points and consider that number as the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Factor of Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding example of number of kids in each house hold, the median and the mean were close to eachother because there were not a lot of outliers. we had 0,1,2 and 3 kids, but we did not have any family that had like 20 kids or 30 kids. That would have skewed the mean (0+2+3+2+1+0+0+2+0+20)/10 = 30/3 = 10 but the median would not have changed much which would come to 1.5. Thus Median is less susceptible to outliers than mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of why median is a better to determine central tendency - \n",
    "You can talk about the mean or average household income in the United States, and that actual number from last year was 72,000 or so, but that doesn't really provide an accurate picture of what the typical American makes. That is because, if you look at the median income, it's much lower at 51,939. Why is that? Well, because of income inequality. There are a few very rich\n",
    "people in America. Here the mean or average is heavily skewed by few Outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great example of where the median tells a much better story about the typical person or data point in this example than the mean does. Whenever someone talks about the mean, you have to think about what does the data distribution looks like. Are there outliers that might be skewing that mean? And if the answer is potentially yes, you should also ask for the median, because often, that provides more insight than the mean or the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode means the most common data point in Data Set. Using the same data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Childern in each house on a Street  0,2,3,2,1,0,0,2,0\n",
    "\n",
    "How many of each value are there:\n",
    "\n",
    "0:4\n",
    "\n",
    "1:1\n",
    "\n",
    "2:3\n",
    "\n",
    "3:1\n",
    "\n",
    "The MODE is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode is good for Discrete Data and does not give much information for Continuous Data. If you have Continuous Range of data, Unless you quantize that somehow into discrete values using Mode does not give much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode is usually only relevant to discrete numerical data, and not to continuous data.\n",

    "If X is a discrete random variable (i.e, X can only take a countable number of values), then the probability mass function of X at x, denoted by p(x), gives the probability that the random variable X takes on the value x. That is p(x) = P(X = x). Example consider you flip a coin, Then what is the probability that a random variable takes a value of tails p(x) = P(X=tails) = 0.5\n",

    "The probability density function is the continuous analog of probability mass function. Consider X to be a continuous random variable (i.e, X can take an uncountable number of values). The value of the probability density function of X at x is denoted by f(x). The greater f(x) is, the higher the probability that the value of X is near x.\n",
    "NOTE: f(x) ≠ P(X = x). In fact if X is continuous P(X=x) = 0 for all x.\n",

    "If you sort all the data in a data set, a given percentile is a point at which that percent of data is less than the point you are at. When we talk about 99th Percentile, then 99th Percentile will be the point at which 99% of the population is less than that value. In terms of income distribution is 99th Percentile is an income of 500000 that means that at the point of income of 500000 99% of the population's income is less than 500000.\n",

    "Kurtosis reveals our data distribution in two linked ways: the shape of the tail, or the how sharp the peak If I just squish the tail down it kind of pushes up that peak to be pointier, and likewise, if I were to push down that distribution, you can imagine that's kind of spreading things out a little bit, making the tails a little bit fatter, and the peak of it a little bit lower. So that's what kurtosis means, and in this example, kurtosis is near zero because it is just a plain old normal distribution"

    "In this chapter, we saw the types of data (numeric, categorical, and ordinal data) that you might encounter and how to categorize them and how you treat them differently depending on what kind of data you're dealing with. We also walked through the statistical concepts of mean, median and mode, and we also saw the importance of choosing between median and mean, and that often the median is a better choice than the mean because of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we analyzed how to compute mean, median, and mode using Python in an IPython Notebook file. We learned the concepts of standard deviation and variance in depth and how to compute them in Python. We saw that they’re a measure of the spread of a data distribution. We also saw a way to visualize and measure the actual chance of a given range of values occurring in a dataset using probability density functions and probability mass functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at the types of data distributions (Uniform distribution, Normal or Gaussian distribution, Exponential probability distribution, Binomial probability mass function, Poisson probability mass function) in general and how to visualize them using Python. We analyzed the concepts of percentiles and moments and saw how to compute them using Python."
