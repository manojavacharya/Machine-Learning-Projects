    "# Data Cleaning and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "How well you clean and understand your input data is going to have a huge impact on the quality of your results, May be even more so that which model you choose and how well you tune your model. Cleaning your raw input is often the most important and the most time consuming part of the job as a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of different kinds of problems with data that you need to watch out for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outliers - So maybe you have people that are behaving kind of strangely in your data, and when you dig into them, they turn out to be data you shouldn't be looking at the in first place. A good example would be if you're looking at web log data, and you see one session ID that keeps coming back over, and over, and over again, and it keeps doing something at a ridiculous rate that a human could never do. What you're probably seeing there is a robot, a script that's being run somewhere to actually scrape your website. It might even be some sort of malicious attack. But at any rate, you don't want that behavior data informing your models that are meant to predict the behavior of real human beings using your website. So, watching for outliers is one way to identify types of data that you might want to strip out of your model when you're building it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing Data - What do you do when data's just not there? Going back to the example of a web log, you might have a referrer in that line, or you might not. What do you do if it's not there? Do you create a new classification for missing, or not specified? Or do you throw that line out entirely? You have to think about what the right thing to do is there. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Malicious Data - There might be people trying to game your system, there might be people trying to cheat the system, and you don't want those people getting away with it. Let's say you're making a recommender system. There could be people out there trying to fabricate behavior data in order to promote their new item, right? So, you need to be on the lookout for that sort of thing, and make sure that you're identifying the shilling attacks, or other types of attacks on your input data, and filtering them out from results and don't let them win.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Erroneous Data - What if there's a software bug somewhere in some system that's just writing out the wrong values in some set of situations? It can happen. Unfortunately, there's no good way for you to know about that. But, if you see data that just looks fishy or the results don't make sense to you, digging in deeply enough can sometimes uncover an underlying bug that's causing the wrong data to be written in the first place. Maybe things aren't being combined properly at some point. Maybe sessions aren't being held throughout the entire session. People might be dropping their session ID and getting new session IDs as they go through a website, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Irrelevant Data - A very simple one here. Maybe you're only interested in data from New York City people, or something for some reason. In that case all the data from people from the rest of the world is irrelevant to what you're trying to find out. The first thing you want to do is just throw all that data that away and restrict your data, whittle it down to the data that you actually care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inconsistent Data - This is a huge problem. For example, in addresses, people can write the same address in many different ways: they might abbreviate street or they might not abbreviate street, they might not put street at the end of the street name at all. They might combine lines together in different ways, they might spell things differently, they might use a zip code in the US or zip plus 4 code in the US, they might have a country on it, they might not have a country on it. You need to somehow figure out what are the variations that you see and how can you normalize them all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formatting - This can also be an issue; things can be inconsistently formatted. Take the example of dates: in the US we always do month, day, year (MM/DD/YY), but in other countries they might do day, month, year (DD/MM/YY), who knows. You need to be aware of these formatting differences. Maybe phone numbers have parentheses around the area code, maybe they don't; maybe they have dashes between each section of the numbers, maybe they don't; maybe social security numbers have dashes, maybe they don't. These are all things that you need to watch out for, and you need to make sure that variations in formatting don't get treated as different entities, or different classifications during your processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage in, garbage out. Your model is only as good as the data that you give to it, and this is extremely, extremely true! You can have a very simple model that performs very well if you give it a large amount of clean data, and it could actually outperform a complex model on a more dirty dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always question your results! You don't want to go back and look for anomalies in your input data only when you get a result that you don't like. That will introduce an unintentional bias into your results where you're letting results that you like, or expect, go through unquestioned, right? You want to question thing all the time to make sure that you're always looking out for these things because even if you find a result you like, if it turns out to be wrong, it's still wrong, it's still going to be informing your company in the wrong direction."

    "# Normalizing Numerical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So, sometimes models will be based on several different numerical attributes. If you remember multivariant models, we might have different attributes of a car that we're looking at, and they might not be directly comparable measurements. Or, for example, if we're looking at relationships between ages and incomes, ages might range from 0 to 100, but incomes in dollars might range from 0 to billions, and depending on the currency it could be an even larger range! Some models are okay with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're doing a regression, usually that's not a big deal. But, other models don't perform so well unless those values are scaled down first to a common scale. If you're not careful, you can end up with some attributes counting more than others. Maybe the income would end up counting much more than the age, if you were trying to treat those two values as comparable values in your model."

    "For example, if I'm doing collaborative filtering, and I'm trying to make movie recommendations or something like that, you might have a few power users that have watched every movie ever made, and rated every movie ever made. They could end up having an inordinate influence on the recommendations for everybody else.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't really want a handful of people to have that much power in your system. So, that might be an example where it would be a legitimate thing to filter out an outlier, and identify them by how many ratings they've actually put into the system. Or, maybe an outlier would be someone who doesn't have enough ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone really wanted the mean average income in the United States (and not the median), you shouldn't just throw out Donald Trump because you don't like him. You know the fact is, his billions of dollars are going to push that mean amount up, even if it doesn't budge the median. So, don't fudge your numbers by throwing out outliers. But throw out outliers if it's not consistent with what you're trying to model in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation is a very good measure to detect outliers, You can compute standard deviation of a data set which is more or less like a norrmal distribution, and if you see any points that are one or two standard deviations away those can be considered as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use Box and Whisker Plot to determine outliers. Any points that lie outside the 1.5 times Interquartile Range can be considered as outliers."
