    "# User Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "These are recommendations based on past behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering, by the way, is just a fancy name for saying recommending stuff based on the combination of what you did and what everybody else did, okay? So, it's looking at your behavior and comparing that to everyone else's behavior, to arrive at the things that might be interesting to you that you haven't heard of yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The idea here is we build up a matrix of everything that every user has ever bought, or viewed, or rated, or whatever signal of interest that you want to base the system on. So basically, we end up with a row for every user in our system, and that row contains all the things they did that might indicate some sort of interest in a given product. So, picture a table, I have users for the rows, and each column is an item, okay? That might be a movie, a product, a web page, whatever; you can use his for many different things.\n",
    "2. I then use that matrix to compute the similarity between different users. So, I basically treat each row f this as a vector and I can compute the similarity between each vector of users, based on their behavior.\n",
    "3. Two users who liked mostly the same things would be very similar to each other and I can then sort this by those similarity scores. If I can find all the users similar to you based on their past behavior, I can then find the users most similar to me, and recommend stuff that they liked that I didn't look at yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a example, and it'll make a little bit more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](User_Based_Collaborative_Filtering.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that this nice lady in the preceding image watched Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back and she loved them both. So, we have a user vector, of this lady, giving a 5-star rating to Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also say Mr. Edgy Mohawk Man comes along and he only watched Star Wars. That's the only thing he's seen, he doesn't know about The Empire Strikes Back yet, somehow, he lives in some strange universe where he doesn't know that there are actually many, many Star Wars movies, growing every year in fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can of course say that this guy's actually similar to this other lady because they both enjoyed Star Wars a lot, so their similarity score is probably fairly good and we can say, okay, well, what has this lady enjoyed that he hasn't seen yet? And, The Empire Strikes Back is one, so we can then take that information that these two users are similar based on their enjoyment of Star Wars, find that this lady also liked The Empire Strikes Back, and then present that as a good recommendation for Mr. Edgy Mohawk Man. We can then go ahead and recommend The Empire Strikes Back to him and he'll probably love it."

    "## Limitations of User Based Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, unfortunately, user-based collaborative filtering has some limitations. When we think about relationships and recommending things based on relationships between items and people and whatnot, our mind tends to go on relationships between people. So, we want to find people that are similar to you and recommend stuff that they liked. That's kind of the intuitive thing to do, but it's not the best thing to do! \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the list of some limitations of user-based collaborative filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One problem is that people are fickle; their tastes are always changing. So, maybe that nice lady in the previous example had sort of a brief science fiction action film phase that she went through and then she got over it, and maybe later in her life she started getting more into dramas or romance films or romcoms. So, what would happen if my Edgy Mohawk guy ended up with a high similarity to her just based on her earlier sci-fi period, and we ended up recommending romantic comedies to him as a result? That would be bad. I mean, there is some protection against that in terms of how we compute the similarity scores to begin with, but it still pollutes our data that people's tastes can change over time. So, comparing people to people isn't always a straightforward thing to do, because people change.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The other problem is that there's usually a lot more people than there are things in your system, so 7 billion people in the world and counting, there's probably not 7 billion movies in the world, or 7 billion items that you might be recommending out of your catalog. The computational problem finding all the similarities between all of the users in your system is probably much greater than the problem of finding similarities between the items in your system. So, by focusing the system on users, you're making your computational problem a lot harder than it might need to be, because you have a lot of users, at least hopefully you do if you're working for a successful company. The final problem is that people do bad things. There's a very real economic incentive to make sure that your product or your movie or whatever it is gets recommended to people, and there are people who try to game the system to make that happen for their new movie, or their new product, or their new book, or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It's pretty easy to fabricate fake personas in the system by creating a new user and having them do a sequence of events that likes a lot of popular items and then likes your item too. This is called a shilling attack, and we want to ideally have a system that can deal with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There is research around how to detect and avoid these shilling attacks in user-based collaborative filtering, but an even better approach would be to use a totally different approach entirely that's not so susceptible to gaming the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. That's user-based collaborative filtering. Again, it's a simple concept-you look at similarities between users based on their behavior, and recommend stuff that a user enjoyed that was similar to you, that you haven't seen yet. Now, that does have its limitations as we talked about."

    "## Item Based Collaborative Filtering \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's talk about how item-based collaborative filtering works. It's very similar to user-based collaborative filtering, but instead of users, we're looking at items.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's go back to the example of movie recommendations. The first thing we would do is find every pair of movies that is watched by the same person. So, we go through and find every movie that was watched by identical people, and then we measure the similarity of all those people who viewed that movie to each other. So, by this means we can compute similarities between two different movies, based on the ratings of the people who watched both of those movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's presume I have a movie pair, okay? Maybe Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. I find a list of everyone who watched both of those movies, then I compare their ratings to each other, and if they'r similar then I can say these two movies are similar, because they were rated similarly by people who watched both of them. That's the general idea here. That's one way to do it, there's more than one way to do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "And then I can just sort everything by the movie, and then by the similarity strength of all the similar movies to it, and there's my results for people who liked also liked, or people who rated this highly also rated this highly and so on and so forth. And like I said, that's just one way of doing it. That's step one of item-based collaborative filtering-first I find relationships between movies based on the relationships of the people who watched every given pair of movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It'll make more sense when we go through the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Item_Based_Collaborative_Filtering_2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say that our nice young lady in the preceding image watched Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back and liked both of them, so rated them both five stars or something. Now, along comes Mr. Edgy Mohawk Man who also watched Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back and also liked both of them. So, at this point we can say there's a relationship, there is a similarity between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back based on these two users who liked both movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're going to do is look at each pair of movies. We have a pair of Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, and then we look at all the users that watched both of them, which are these two guys, and if they both liked them, then we can say that they're similar to each other. Or, if they both disliked them we can also say they're similar to each other, right? So, we're just looking at the similarity score of these two users' behavior related to these two movies in this movie pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, along comes Mr. Moustachy Lumberjack Hipster Man and he watches The Empire Strikes Back and he lives in some strange world where he watched The Empire Strikes Back, but had no idea that Star Wars the first movie existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Item_Based_Collaborative_Filtering_3.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's fine, we computed a relationship between The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars based on the behavior of these two people, so we know that these two movies are similar to each other. So, given that Mr. Hipster Man liked The Empire Strikes Back, we can say with good confidence that he would also like Star Wars, and we can then recommend that back to him as his top movie recommendation."

    "### Finding Movie Similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply the concept of item-based collaborative filtering. To start with, movie similarities-figure out what movies are similar to other movies. In particular, we'll try to figure out what movies are similar to Star Wars, based on user rating data, and we'll see what we get out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using some real movie rating data from the GroupLens project. GroupLens.org provides real movie ratings data, by real people who are using the MovieLens.org website to rate movies and get recommendations back for new movies that they want to watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we're going to do is import the u.data file as part of the MovieLens dataset, and that is a tabdelimited file that contains every rating in the dataset. We can specify a different separator than a comma. We're basically saying take the first three columns in the u.data file, and import it into a new DataFrame, with three columns: user_id, movie_id, and rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we end up with here is a DataFrame that has a row for every user_id, which identifies some person, and then, for every movie they rated, we have the movie_id, which is some numerical shorthand for a given movie, so Star Wars might be movie 53 or something, and their rating, you know, 1 to 5 stars. So, we have here a database, a DataFrame, of every user and every movie they rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to be able to work with movie titles, so we can interpret these results more intuitively, so we're going to use their human-readable names instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using a truly massive dataset, you'd save that to the end because you want to be working with numbers, they're more compact, for as long as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a separate data file with the MovieLens dataset called u.item, and it is pipe-delimited, and the first two columns that we import will be the movie_id and the title of that movie. So, now we have two DataFrames: r_cols has all the user ratings and m_cols has all the titles for every movie_id. We can then use the magical merge function in Pandas to mush it all together.\n",

We can see in the preceding output, some movies such as: Full Speed (1996), Man of the Year (1995), The Outlaw (1943). These are all, you know, fairly obscure movies, that most of them I've never even heard of, and yet they have perfect correlations with Star Wars. That's kinda weird!

    "\n",
    "So, just to remind you, we looked for movies that are similar to Star Wars using that technique, and we ended up with a bunch of weird recommendations at the top that had a perfect correlation. And, most of them were very obscure movies. So, what do you think might be going on there? Well, one thing that might make sense is, let's say we have a lot of people watch Star Wars and some other obscure film. We'd end up with a good correlation between these two movies because they're tied together by Star Wars, but at the end of the day, do we really want to base our recommendations on the behavior of one or two people that watch some obscure movie?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably Not. We need to have some sort of confidence level in our similarities by enforcing a minimum boundary of how many people watched a given movie. We can't make a judgment that a given movie is good just based on the behavior of one or two people. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we're going to do is try to identify the movies that weren't actually rated by many people and we'll just throw them out and see what we get. So, to do that we're going to take our original ratings DataFrame and we're going to say groupby('title'). And, this will basically construct a new DataFrame that aggregates together all the rows for a given title into one row. We can say that we want to aggregate specifically on the rating, and we want to show both the size, the number of ratings for each movie, and the mean average score, the mean rating for that movie."

    "This is starting to look a little bit better! So, Star Wars (1977) comes out on top because it's similar to itself, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is number 2, Return of the Jedi (1983) is number 3, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), number 4. You know, it's still not perfect, but these make a lot more sense, right? So, you would expect the three Star Wars films from the original trilogy to be similar to each other, this data goes back to before the next three films, and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is also a very similar movie to Star Wars in style, and i comes out as number 4. So, I'm starting to feel a little bit better about these results. There's still room for improvement, but hey! We got some results that make sense, whoo-hoo!"

    "We have here a new DataFrame where every movie is on the row, and in the column. So, we can look at the intersection of any two given movies and find their correlation score to each other based on this userRatings data that we had up here originally. For  example, the movie 101 Dalmatians (1996) is perfectly correlated with itself of course, because it has identical user rating vectors.

Running that will get rid of the spurious relationships that are based on just a handful of people."

So, we gave a rating of 5 star to The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars (1977), and a rating of 1 star to Gone with the Wind (1939).

For i in range 0 through the number of ratings that we have in myRatings, we are going to add up similar movies to the ones that were rated. So, we are going to take that corrMatrix DataFrame, that one that has all of the movie similarities, and we are going to create a correlation matrix with myRatings, drop any missing values, and then we are going to scale that resulting correlation score by how well the movies were rated. So, the idea here is that we are going to go through all the similarities for The Empire Strikes Back, for example, and I will scale it all by 5, because I really liked The Empire Strikes Back. But, when I go through and get the similarities for Gone with the Wind, I'm only going to scale those by 1, because I did not like Gone with the Wind. So, this will give more strength to movies that are similar to movies that I liked, and less strength to movies that are similar to movies that I did not like,"
